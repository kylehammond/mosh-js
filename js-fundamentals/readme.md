This repo includes my completed work for both programmingwithmosh.com JavaScript courses.

* JavaScript fundamentals
* OOP JavaScript including ES5 / ES6

It's a great training and worth every penny. 

The code was modified in the same index.js/index.html files for most of the training until the very end.  So I would follow along and code / exercises and create new commits for each module.

This is for my future reference.
