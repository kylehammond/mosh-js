// 4 pillars of OOP

// encapsulation
// group related variables and functions together
// benefits: reduce complexity, increase reusability

// abstraction
// hide details and complexity and only show essential
// benefits: reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes

// inheritance
// allow objects to inherit properties or methods from others
// benefits:  eliminate redundant code

// polymorphism
// allow overlap of functionality and properties
// benefits: refactor ugly switch/case/control flow logic
